### OAuth 2.0 allows a user to authorize your app to work with specific tools in their HubSpot account, designated by the authorization scopes you set.

#### Note: if you want a Django version, I have contributed a hubspot integration for [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth)

### Stack:

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) ([Because of recent license change](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/2786))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Portability)
- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) (Light resource usage)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (CI)
- [Mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (Dead simple local SSL certs)
- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) (Testing)

**Note:** This app by default only passes `oauth` scope when logging in users. You will need to add the appropriate scope to take advantage of other tools that a user might have. More about that [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/initiate-oauth-integration#scopes)

## Pre-requisites
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

## Steps to run

#### 1. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/vladdoster/hubspot_oauth2_with_flask.git`

#### 2. Change directories to cloned repository

`cd hubspot_oauth2_with_flask/`

#### 3. Generate SSL certificates to appease HubSpot HTTPS requirement for oauth callback. A script has been written to aid this effort.

`sh ./scripts/generate_certs`
If the scrip does not work, here's how you can do it manually for Windows:
  1. Install Chocolatey (will be needed for installing mkcert) [Link to Installation](https://chocolatey.org/install)
  2. Install mkcert `choco install mkcert`
  3. Redicrect to "/certs" and run  `mkcert -install hs-oauth.localhost`
  
**Note:** Linux users install OpenSSL via system package manager and Windows users need to install OpenSSL via a .exe

If successful, you should have a key.pem and cert.pem file in the certs/ directory

#### 4. Set HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID and HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET in .env.

#### 5. Run app

docker-compose up --build

#### 6. Direct a browser towards [https://hs-oauth.localhost](https://hs-oauth.localhost)!
